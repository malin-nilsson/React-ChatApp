# Ciao - React Chat App
This is a Microsoft Teams clone built with React JS and Chat Engine. <br/>
It was built following JavaScript Mastery's step-by-step YouTube tutorial: https://youtu.be/jcOKU9f86XE

My goal with this project was to learn how to think in React, get familiar with React concepts and practice writing JSX.
